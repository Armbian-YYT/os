# What does this project do?

- Keeps build framework [packages artifacts](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/packages) cache up to date
- Keeps stable [apt.armbian.com](https://apt.armbian.com) and nightly [beta.armbian.com](https://beta.armbian.com) packages repository up to date
- Builds [nightly](https://github.com/armbian/os/releases) and [stable images](https://www.armbian.com/download/) and uploads them to Armbian CDN
- Keep synchronizing the selection of [3rd party](external) applications with Armbian repositories
- Tests install of all packages added onto stable and testing Debian and Ubuntu releases

# When is this happening?

- Artifacts cache is updated every eight hours, starting at 0:00 AM UTC
- Repository update is updated once per day, at 3:00 AM UTC
- Smoke tests is executed after **repository update** is finished.
- Nightly images are build once per day, at 5:00 AM UTC
- Manually, when Armbian [release manager](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/teams/release-manager) executes a build action

# Want to enable images for your board?

Armbian build system includes many build configurations, but we are producing only some possible build options for all images. Only the most popular ones get everything, while others get the bare minimum, some nothing. 

To enable a board that exists in [build configurations](https://github.com/armbian/build/tree/main/config/boards), edit [yaml files here](userpatches/) and send a pull request. The configuration file is self-explanatory.
