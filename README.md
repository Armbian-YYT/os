# What does this project do?

- Keeps build framework [packages artifacts](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/packages) cache up to date
- Keeps stable [apt.armbian.com](https://apt.armbian.com) and nightly [beta.armbian.com](https://beta.armbian.com) packages repository up to date
- Builds [nightly](https://github.com/armbian/os/releases) and [stable images](https://www.armbian.com/download/) and uploads them to Armbian CDN
- Keep synchronizing the selection of [3rd party](external) applications with Armbian repositories
- Tests install of all packages added onto stable and testing Debian and Ubuntu releases

# How to enable images?

If you want to enable build configurations, edit [yaml config files](/armbian/os/tree/main/userpatches) and send a pull request. ([example](https://github.com/armbian/os/commit/70f3be4f3d96e9a301be751d3ecf3a24394356f9) )

# When is this happening?

- Artifacts cache is updated every eight hours, starting at 0:00 AM UTC
- Repository update is updated once per day, at 3:00 AM UTC
- Smoke tests is executed after **repository update** is finished.
- Nightly images are build once per day, at 5:00 AM UTC
- Manually, when Armbian [release manager](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/teams/release-manager) executes a build action

# Latest smoke tests results:

- installs kernels, dtb and headers that are defined and supported by the board
- runs network and computing performance tests (7z benchmark)
- store armbianmonitor logs
